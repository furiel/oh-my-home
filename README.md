# Quick emacs and zsh configuration
This repository contains basic configuration and setup script for emacs and zsh. Thus providing a convenient way to "move in" to a new environment.
The zsh configuration is based on the popular oh-my-zsh.
Some emacs packages are installed from melpa/elpa.

Public usage is *NOT* recommended. You will lose your existing emacs/zsh configuration or break your system. I warned you...

## Basic Installation

Installation can be done by one of the following commands in your terminal. You can install this via the command-line with either `curl` or `wget`.
